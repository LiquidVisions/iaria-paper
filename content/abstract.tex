    This paper investigates Clean Architecture through the lens of Normalized Systems,
    expanding on the research presented in the thesis of \citetitle{koks_convergence_2023}
    from \citename{koks_convergence_2023}{author}. The study highlight the synergetic
    potential of Clean Architecture and Normalized Systems to enhance the evolvability of
    Software design. The research includes a theoretical analysis, supported by imperical
    evidence from the development and evaluation of two research artifacts. It
    demonstrates how each paradigm contributes to a modular, stable, and evolvable software
    design and how integrating both approaches can lead an evaolvable software design.
