    This paper investigates Clean Architecture through the lens of Normalized Systems. It
    highlights the synergetic potential of Clean Architecture and Normalized Systems to
    enhance the evolvability of Software design. The research includes a theoretical
    analysis supported by empirical evidence from the development and evaluation of two
    research artifacts. It demonstrates how each paradigm contributes to a modular,
    stable, and evolvable software design and how integrating both approaches can lead an
    evolvable software design.
