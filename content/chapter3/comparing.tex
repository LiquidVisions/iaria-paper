\section{Comparing Normalized Systems with Clean Architecture}

This Section delves into the convergence of \gls{ca} and \gls{ns}, exploring their
convergence and application in software design. The discussion is anchored in the results
of the research  \citetitle{koks_convergence_2023} \cite{koks_convergence_2023}, which
meticulously examines the principles and design elements of both \gls{ca} and \gls{ns}
mentioned in previous chapters. By aligning the theoretical constructs of both paradigms,
the thesis provides a perspective on achieving modular, evolvable, and stable software
architectures. This convergence reinforces the robustness of software systems and enhances
their evolvability and longevity in the face of future requirements. The subsequent
sections will summarize the key components of their convergence by highlighting the
practical implications and the potential for evolvable software design.
