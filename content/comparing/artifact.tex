\subsection{The Artifact}
A vital aspect of the thesis, and by extension, this paper, is the empirical examination of
\gls{ca} and \gls{ns} within a software artifact. The practical application of the
artifacts substantiates the theoretical constructs, effectively narrowing down the divide
between theory and practice. The research substantiates the efficacy and compatibility
of these methodologies through a detailed analysis of the implementation and performance
of \gls{ca} and \gls{ns} principles in an operational software system. This empirical
dimension corroborates the theoretical perspectives and offers a pragmatic example through
which these architectural paradigms can be applied in modern software development
contexts.
